# Animation-Records

This web was made for Animation Records, to fulfill their need for a merchandise web.

## Description

They requested a development team to make a website to publish their products. This static web should be composed of a home page that would have a header with the logotype, the name of the company, the navigation menu (home and categories), the shopping cart icon with the specified number of products that the customer would like to buy, a promotional banner, a categories gallery, a section with a form to subscribe to the newsletter and a footer with the corresponded copyright as well as the company number.

When the customer clicks on a category, the gallery page of the related products will be displayed. From the product gallery, a link is required to go back to the previous page and on the product detail page, a link like the one mentioned above will also be available.

Once you visit a category page when you click on a product you will be redirected to the detail page of this product which will have the product photo, descriptive text, the add to cart button, the like icon which will change status when you click on it, and there will be also, a recommended products section.
